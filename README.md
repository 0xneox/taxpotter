# Ether Tax Aid

A tool to help Ethereum holders calculate their capital gains taxes owed.

See the progress here - https://ether-tax-aid.surge.sh/

### Getting started

**IMPORTANT!**

Make sure you are using a browser that has the [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) extension installed. I highly recommend the [Brave](https://brave.com/) browser. Chrome will also do the trick.

### A few notes

*   Right now the app only works with addresses that have a small handful of transactions. This is due to restrictions placed on large numbers of requests made to the API to retrieve the historical prices of Ethereum. I am working on a solution to support addresses that have much larger numbers of transactions. In the meantime please use the example addresses provided on the home page, or feel free to input your own addresses- provided they have less than 15 transactions associated with them.
*   This app is a work in progress, and with a lot of uncertainty regarding crypto assets and the tax code... lets just say that the information provided for a given address will almost certainly change a lot over time.
